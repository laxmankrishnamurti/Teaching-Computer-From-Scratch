# **What happens when we double click on any file?**

- If there is any file it must have an extension.
- OS also reads the content of the file.
- Extension tells the **type of file** so that OS can recongnize the file.
- And identify the appropriate application software to open.

Ex :- If we have a file named "file.ods".

- ODS :: Libre Calc
