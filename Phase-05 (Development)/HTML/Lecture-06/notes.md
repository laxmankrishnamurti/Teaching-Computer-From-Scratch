## Why do we need a boilerplate code?

- It provides basic /structure layout of a webpage(A page where we render our content).
- It helps in SEO (Search Engine Optimization).

## Boilerplate Code Explanation.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

With that we tell the browser that this is going to be a HTML file.

## HTML Tag

```html
<html lang="en"></html>
```

This is the place where our HTML file actually begins.

```html
lang="en"
```

This is called an Attribute.

# What is an Attribute.

- It gives extra infromation about the tag.
- It always lyies in the opening tag.

```html
<html lang="en"></html>
```

## Head Tag

```html
<head></head>
```

- We write metadata(data about data) for the webpage.
- We bundle our metadata using this tag.

## Meta Tag

```html
<meta charset="UTF-8" />
```

- It helps to identify all characters.

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
```

- It helps to make our website responsive.

## Body Tag

```html
<body></body>
```

- Here we write our content that we want to render on the webpage.
