# What is HTML

HTML stands for Hyper-Text Markup Language. It is used to create website structure. It is not a kind of programming language.

It decides where the content should placed on a webpage so that's why we called it as a Markup Language.

- HTML offers lots of tags.
- Every tag has an opening and closing tag.
- And we write content in between to display on the webpage.

```html
<title>Page Title</title>
```

Opening Tag : <title>
Closing Tag : </title>
Content : Page Title
