# **`🧱 BLOCK-LEVEL TAGS (Grouped by Topic)`**


### 📦 Semantic Layout

* `<header>`: Represents introductory content or navigational links.
* `<footer>`: Contains footer content like copyright or contact info.
* `<main>`: Represents the main content of the document.
* `<nav>`: Container for navigation links.
* `<section>`: Groups related content under a theme.

🔍 When to Use `<section>` (vs other tags like `<div>`)

| Tag         | When to Use                                                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<section>` | For logically grouped **content with a heading** (semantic).          |
| `<div>`     | For generic containers, mainly for **styling/layout** (non-semantic). |


* `<article>`: Represents a self-contained piece of content (like a blog post).
* `<aside>`: Represents content that is tangentially related to the main content (like a sidebar, tips, or advertisements). Use it for side notes, related links, or extra information.
* `<figure>`: Groups media content like images or illustrations.
* `<figcaption>`: Caption for a `<figure>` element.
