# **`Ideological Subversion`**

Ideological Subversion is the process, to change to perception of reality to such an extent that despite of the abundance of information, no one is able to come to come to sensible conclusion.

It is great brainwashing process which goes very slow and is divided in four basic stages.

- The highest art of warfare is not to fight at all. But to **_Subvert_** anything of value in the country of your enemy.

## **STAGE : 01 (DEMORALIZATION)**

In case of religion, destroy it. Ridicule it. Replace it with various sects, cults. And take it away from the supreme purpose of religion. To keep people in touch with the supreme being.

Distract people's attention from the real religious organizations, with fake organizations.

There are obviously, in every society, there are people who are against the society. The moment all these movements will be directed in one direction, this is the time to catch that movement and to continue it untill the movement forces the whole society, into collapse, into crisis.

Education.
Distract them learning something which is constructive, pragmatic, efficient. Take away the initiative from people. Take away the responsibility from naturally established links between individuals, group of individuals, and society at large and replaced them with artificially, bureaucratically, controlled bodies.

## **STAGE : 02 (DESTABILIZATION)**

Dropouts, or half baked intellectuals are now occupying the position of power in government, civil service, business, mass media, education system. _You are stuck with them._ You cannot get rid of them. They are programmed to think and react to certain stimuli, in a certain pattern.

You cannot change their mind even if you expose them to authentic information. Even if you prove that white is white and black is black. You still cannot change the basic perception and the logical behaviour.

We think that subverter is a person who is going to blow up our beautiful bridges. NO!

Subverter is a student who comes for exchange...
a diplomat...
an actor ...
an artist ...

Advice :: You need another 20 or 15 years to educate a new generation of patriotically minded and common sense people. Who would be acting in favour and in the interest of the society.

On this stage, the students are being sent back. Or if they were already in the country which is the object of subversion. They spring to action. The sleepers go up.

They slept for 15 to 20 years. Now they become leaders of groups...
preachers...
public figures...

They actively include themselves into political process.

Fifteen years ago he did his dirty job and nobody cared. Now, he makes it a political issue. He demands recognition, respect, human rights, and he relies a large group of people. And there are violent clashes. Between him and police. His group and ordinary people.

**`That is DESTABILIZATION`**

## **STAGE : 03 (CRISIS)**

Destabilization process usually leads directly to the process of crisis. It may take only six weeks to bring a country to the verge of crisis.

The population at large is looking for a saviour. Population is sick and tired already.

A saviour comes and says I will lead you. Who is a half-baked intellectual sometimes graduated from Harvard University or third..

He comes back to his country and he thinks that he knows the answer to all the social economical problems.

So we have two alternatives here.

1. Civil War..
   and
2. Invasion.

The time bomd is ticking. Every second. The disaster is coming closer and closer.
